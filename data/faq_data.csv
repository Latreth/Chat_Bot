How does schooling outside school work?,In addition to the double degree courses completed abroad the engineering curriculum can be per- sonalized by completing part of the course outside the Ecole Centrale de Lyon in two ways: by replacing one or more complete semesters at the Ecole Centrale de Lyon by the same number of semesters followed in another establishment or by replacing one or more Training Actions by courses followed in another training course. \n The validation of one or several complete semesters can take several forms exclusive of each other: \n - to complete the fourth semester in a foreign establishment in replacement of semester S8 on condition that the first three semesters have been completed at the Ecole Centrale de Lyon;\n - to complete the fourth and fifth semesters in a foreign establishment in replacement of semesters S8 and S9 on condition that the first three semesters have been completed at the Ecole Centrale de Lyon; \n - complete the fifth semester and the sixth semester (3rd year) in a French or foreign partner establishment of Ecole Centrale de Lyon in replacement of semesters S9 and S10 on condition that the first four semesters have been completed within Ecole Centrale de Lyon and that the final internship of the engineering curriculum (TFE) has been completed. \n The list of students authorized by the School to spend the fifth and sixth semesters in a foreign establishment and the list of students authorized by the School to spend the fifth and sixth semesters in another establishment are drawn up by the Director of Ecole Centrale de Lyon on the proposal of the Commission des Echanges Universitaires. Each student's programme of study in the host establishment is described in a written undertaking signed by the student and approved by the Director of Ecole Centrale de Lyon or his representative. This document is transmitted to the Jury of the Elective Course the only one authorized to validate the results obtained in the host establishment. The practical organization methods are defined in Appendix A "Personalization of the engineering curriculum" page 10. The replacement of the validation of one or several Training Actions of the Elective Pathway by the validation of courses followed in another training course must be validated by the Elective Pathway Development Commission defined in Appendix A "Personalization of the engineering curriculum" page 10 according to the methods presented in Appendix B "Evaluation of knowledge and skills" page 12.
What is the organization of schooling with a disability?,Disability is defined in article L.114 of the Social Action and Family Code: "A disability [...] is any limitation of activity or restriction of participation in society suffered by a person in his or her environment as a result of a substantial lasting or permanent impairment of one or more physical- sensory- mental- cognitive or psychological functions of a multiple disability or a disabling health disorder". In accordance with Decree number 2005-1617 of 21 December 2005 relating to "adjustments to examinations and competitive examinations in school and higher education for candidates with disabilities" for a student or auditor with a disability- the engineering training is adjusted according to the disability at the level of examinations and other tests of knowledge and skills and at the level of the complete course of study. The practical organisational arrangements are defined in Appendix F "Schooling in a situation of disability" on page 24.

I submitted my master's application on Campus France. How will I be informed of the response?,Please consult the Campus France platform.
I do not have a National Identifier Number (INE). However it is not possible to validate my registration file because I am asked for this number. What to do?,If you are registered for the first time in France and you come as part of an exchange program- this number will be assigned by the Ecole Centrale de Lyon at the time of validation of the file. Check the box "I don't have an INE"- which will allow you to finalize your registration.

I am asked for my address but I don't know it yet. What to do ?,Do not wait to know your address to complete the registration process. The faster your registration will be done- the faster we can get back to you if the file is incomplete or invalid. Just fill in the current address or a stable address (that of parents for example). You just have to change your address on the site when it becomes known.The registration addresses are as follows:inscription.ec-lyon.fr if you do not already have an online account at Ecole Centrale de Lyon. inscriptions.ec-lyon.fr/fr/ia/reinscription if you already have one.
I received an email informing me that my file is incomplete and that certain parts of my file are missing or incorrect. What to do ?, These are generally supplied supporting documents which are missing- which are not legible or valid. Log on to the site to replace the necessary documents before the start of the school year:inscription.ec-lyon.fr if you do not yet have an online account at the Ecole Centrale de Lyon. inscriptions.ec-lyon.fr/fr/ia/reinscription if you already have one. Check that the document is readable. If not submit a new document after checking that you can read it! When you replace documents- there is no need to notify the tuition service. The file will be processed.Examples of documents to modify:Jpeg document filed in previous years or other unreadable documents - replace the document with a pdf format.
Document not corresponding to the situation announced on the site (eg scholarships etc.) or the academic year. It is not a sufficiently official document. In any case- check the type of document requested.
I would like to change a document posted on the registration portal. How to do so ?, As long as schooling has not validated your file- you can log in to modify the documents provided:inscription.ec-lyon.fr if you do not already have an online account at Ecole Centrale de Lyon . inscriptions.ec-lyon.fr/fr/ia/reinscription if you already have one.
I have submitted new documents to the registration site and have received no return yet., You can check if your part has been validated by reconnecting on the registration site. If not- it will be processed soon. There are many registrations and we do our best to process all requests as quickly as possible.
When am I actually enrolled at the Ecole Centrale de Lyon?,The issuance of the schooling certificate and the student card or sticker officially validates enrollment in the establishment. This will only be final after payment of all registration fees.
